# TheRum
This Repo is a conglomeration of notes, scripts, repo builders, Dockerfiles, docker-compose files, file lists, and so much more. 

I use this to help me keep track of what I am working on and just a place to put things.  

I should really clean this up... but it works for me and no one else uses it.

A lot of the .sh and .ps1 files are just named that way for syntax highlighting. 

Like I said, I should fix this...
